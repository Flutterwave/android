An Android library for Flutterwave

This project was created using Android Studio 2.2

Add the library to your project in one of two ways: 
1. Add the compiled AAR (or JAR) file:
	i. Click File > New Module.
   ii. Click Import .JAR/.AAR Package then click Next.
  iii. Enter the location of the AAR or JAR file then click Finish.
2. Import the library module to your project:
    i. Click File > New > Import Module.
   ii. Enter the location of the library module directory then click Finish.
  iii. The library module is copied to your project, so you can actually edit the library code. If you want to maintain a single version of the library code, then this is probably not what you want and you should instead import the compiled AAR file as described above.

Pull requests are welcome for new features... Thanks.
